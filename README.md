This project is ongoing and studies research and development (R&D) expenditure trends and the relationship between R&D expenditure and economic growth (GDP) since 2012 using the ANBERD dataset and World Bank data. The programming language used is Python. 

Trends

Germany, the United States (US), China and Japan were selected for further analysis as these countries had the overall highest R&D expenditure.

Among the four countries, the US has the overall highest GDP followed closely by Germany. Japan had the lowest variability of GDP and China the greatest.

The following shows a time series for the four countries. R&D expediture (right) GDP (left)

US, Germany, and China show a linear growth trend both of GDP and R&D expenditure for the observed years. Japan shows a higher variability of growth for both variables.

Relationship

Normalization, linear regression, Pearson, Kendall, Spearman were used as correlation methods to determine the relationship between R&D expenditure and GDP.

All four countries showed a positive linear relationship between the two variables. Validation efforts remain ongoing.

A similar analysis was conducted for Italy, France, Korea, and the United Kingdom. The trend analysis showed greater variability for R&D expenditure and GDP and only Korea indicated a strong linear relationship between the variables.

Additional efforts will possibly include a wider analysis of historical data, prediction methods, and the implementation of ML techniques.
