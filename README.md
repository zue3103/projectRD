I would like to analyze the ANBERD dataset on the research and development (R&D) expenditure using Python. 
The ultimate goal will be to determine trends for R&D expenditure for the last 5 to 10 years. 
In the second part of my analysis, I will study the relationship between R&D expenditure and economic growth using a regression model. 
For economic growth, I will use an additional dataset. Several researchers, governments, and organizations, 
including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have been studying R&D expenditure and its impact on economic growth to make educated governance and investment decisions. 
As described in the literature review, several researcher have done studies understanding trends and determining relationships between R&D and other factors. 
The ANBERG dataset will be updated in March 2023. I will be one of the first researchers using the updated dataset to study R&D expenditure trends and the relationship 
with economic growth and my goal is to conclude the project by the end of the semester. My analysis can be applied to many different areas.
With a projected recession in many countries around the world in 2023 understanding historical R&D expenditure data and its impact on economic growth 
will influence companyâ€™s and government investment decisions.
